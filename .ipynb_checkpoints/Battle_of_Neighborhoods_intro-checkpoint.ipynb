    "In this notebook, I will be exploring the city of Monrovia using the Foursquare location data. Monrovia is the capital of Liberia in West Africa. In addition to it being the capital, it is the largest and commercial hub of the country. Major restaurants, bars, hotels and large businesses are situated in Monrovia. It consist of the largest purchasing power of the population in the country.
